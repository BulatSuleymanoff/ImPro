Image Processing Algorithms in C++

The Main function shows some functionality of the mini-library:  
1) Generates smoothed images  
2) action 1) and shows, what was difference of processed and original image  
3) action 2) and sharpen original image
  using this difference  
4) Sharpens image with Laplacian of Gaussian  
5) Detects edges with Prewitt and Sobel filters  ads
